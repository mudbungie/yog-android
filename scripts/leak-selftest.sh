# yog-android leak scan — the regression half, and the reason the gate cannot rot.
#
# SOURCED, never executed: `scripts/leak-scan.sh --self-test` sources this into
# its own shell, so the harness runs against the SAME `scan`/`scan_rule`/
# `scan_paths`/`scan_binary` the gate runs — a self-test that re-implemented the
# mechanism would prove only that the copy still works. It lives in its own file
# because the scanner is at the 300-line cap and "mechanism" and "the proof the
# mechanism still bites" are a real seam, not a shaved line (AGENTS.md).
#
# A leak gate does not die by being wrong; it dies by silently matching nothing
# after a pattern is edited, and then passing everything forever. So every rule
# owns a fixture (`scripts/leak-fixtures/<rule>.txt`) in which EVERY non-comment
# line must be flagged BY THAT RULE — line granularity, not file granularity, so
# one dead alternative inside a nine-way pattern cannot hide behind the eight
# that still work — and must carry `FIXTURE_MARKER`, because no regex can tell a
# real secret from a fabricated one and only the value can say so. The other
# direction is `clean.txt` / `clean-paths.txt`: near-misses that must NOT be
# flagged, because a gate that cries wolf on a fifth of the tree gets bypassed,
# and a bypassed gate is no gate.

# Every non-blank, non-'#' line of a rule's fixture must be flagged BY THAT
# RULE and must carry FIXTURE_MARKER; nothing in the clean fixtures may be
# flagged by anything.
