# yog-android leak rules — the TABLE, and only the table. `scripts/leak-scan.sh`
# is the mechanism that runs it; this file is what counts as a leak. Adapted
# from yog's table (its bl-167d rework), which is the parent copy: a rule
# learned in either repo should be weighed for both, because two tables of the
# same discipline drift within a week.
#
# Sourced, never executed.
#
#   PATTERN — ERE matched with `grep -o`, so a hit is the offending text.
#   EXCEPT  — dropped if the matched text matches this ERE, ANCHORED AT THE
#             START of the match (there is nowhere else to anchor: the hit line
#             is `path:line:match`, so `^` would mean the path, while `$` does
#             mean the end of the match, because the match ends the line).
#             Write a leading `.*` where you mean "contains".
#   WHY     — printed with the finding; it must say what to DO.
#
# ONE INVARIANT GOVERNS THIS FILE: **no pattern here may match this file.**
# The scanner scans itself and this table — bl-167d deleted the exemption that
# made the file the rules live in the one place a leak could not be seen — so a
# rule whose literal text is also an instance of itself would flag the table
# forever. Exactly one ever was: PuTTY's key banner, the only bare literal with
# nothing after it. It is written `Fil[e]` for that reason, the same idiom as
# `ps | grep '[s]shd'`. Every other pattern is self-immune already, because its
# literal prefix is followed by a bracket expression or an alternation bar.
#
# There is no per-rule path exemption and no allowlist. There was one — a SKIP
# prefix for `docs/drive-logs/`, whose files were operator-home paths by the
# hundred — and bl-244f burned those logs rather than keep the carve-out they
# justified. Every rule applies to every tracked file. Add an escape back only
# when a rule is wrong, and fix the rule instead if you can.

# **The table is a `case`, not a `declare -A` map** (bl-1015). Associative
# arrays need bash 4; macOS ships bash 3.2 and, the licence having changed under
# it, always will — so a subscripted table made this gate, and every test of it,
# Linux-only on a repo whose CI builds both platforms.
#
# The shape it takes is load-bearing twice over. A rule's three fields stay
# **together**, under its name and its own commentary, which is what makes this
# a table rather than three lists to keep in step. And the name on the left of
# every `=` is `PATTERN`/`EXCEPT`/`WHY`, never the rule's own — which is what
# keeps the file self-immune under the invariant above: spelled the other way
# (`WHY_vendor_token=`) the *variable name* is itself an instance of
# `credential-assignment`, and the table flags itself forever.
#
#   rule_fields home-path   ->  $PATTERN, $EXCEPT, $WHY for that rule
#
# A rule with no EXCEPT leaves it empty, and so does a name no arm matches;
# there is no error case, because RULES below is the only source of names.

  # could not see the author's home at all, and no box but the author's could
