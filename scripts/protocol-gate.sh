# protocol-gate.sh — this app does not release a wire protocol version that no
# published engine speaks (bl-5b19; yog bl-bca2 is the other direction).
#
#   scripts/protocol-gate.sh hello        this repo's hello file, one path
#   scripts/protocol-gate.sh read FILE    the PROTOCOL integer that file states
#   scripts/protocol-gate.sh judge PUBLISHED CANDIDATE
#   scripts/protocol-gate.sh --self-test  both directions, no network
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. yog mints the wire protocol version; this repository, the
# seat (`lernie`) and the foot (`thrall`) each VENDOR a copy of the constant,
# and the wire is fail-closed on a mismatch with no negotiation (yog
# `docs/REMOTE.md` §3). The
# skew that opens is therefore two-directional and each direction is gated in
# the repository that can decide it:
#
#   1. yog publishing a bump AHEAD of its consumers. Held at yog's release pull
#      request until this repository's `main` — and lernie's, and thrall's —
#      carries the new number. That is yog bl-bca2.
#   2. THIS repository releasing a bump ahead of the engine. thrall took that
#      road first — 0.0.15 published PROTOCOL 16 while the newest published
#      yog, 0.0.49, spoke 15, a component ahead of every engine a user can
#      install. The phone's landing is worse: the §20 update offer carries a
#      released APK to every device that taps it, and one that speaks a number
#      no engine speaks can dial nothing.
#
# THE ORDERING THE TWO GATES PRODUCE, and the one thing to remember when
# bumping: **the consumers' mains carry the number first, then yog publishes,
# then the consumers publish.** Gate 1 enforces the first arrow, gate 2 the
# second. Landing the constant on `main` is never held by either — it is what
# gate 1 waits for.
#
# STRICTLY GREATER, NOT DIFFERENT. An app BEHIND the published engine is
# direction 1's defect, and its release is the fix; holding it would hold the
# remedy shut.
#
# THIS FILE IS PURE LOGIC AND READS NO NETWORK, which is what makes the rule
# testable: `.github/workflows/release-plz.yml`'s `merge-release-pr` job
# fetches the two `hello.rs` files — yog's at its newest `v<x.y.z>` tag, and
# this repository's at the release pull request's head — and hands this script
# the paths.
