//! **The DHT rendezvous client** (yog REMOTE §13.2) — a pure client of the
//! mainline DHT (BEP 5): outbound-UDP iterative lookups and BEP 44 signed
//! mutable get/put, and never a node. No listener, no routing answers, no
//! storage offered — nothing for the commons to dial back, which is REMOTE
//! §13's ruling 2 applied to the rendezvous itself, and DESIGN §1's *"the
//! phone opens no listening socket"* one layer down.
//!
//! **Reimplemented per component, as REMOTE §13.7 ruling 2 recommends**, from
//! the engine's own `src/dht` (yog bl-df31): a DHT client is substrate, not
//! protocol, and at under nine hundred lines a copy costs less than a fifth
//! repository's release machinery. Nothing in it is yog-shaped and nothing
//! in it is phone-shaped either — no world, no boundary, no wire type crosses
//! its interface, and its one dependency is `ring`, which rustls already
//! links (DESIGN §21). What this end uses it for is the client half alone:
//! `get` reads the engine's presence, `put` writes the call.
//!
//! The shape the punched wire consumes is this module root: a caller hands
//! [`Dht::new`] a [`Transport`] (the std UDP socket [`Udp`], or a stand-in),
//! the bootstrap addresses and a [`Config`], then asks [`Dht::lookup`] for
//! the nodes nearest an id, [`Dht::get`] for the newest item under a key and
//! salt, or [`Dht::put`] to store one a [`Keypair`] signed — and, after any
//! of them, [`Dht::observed`] for where the commons saw it come from (yog
//! bl-efae; the call names it, DESIGN §21). Everything the
//! commons answers is untrusted until it verifies: an item without a good
//! signature under the asked-for key is not an item.
//!
//! Four files under this root, one concern each: `bencode` the encoding,
//! `krpc` the datagram shapes, `mutable` the signed item, `transport` the
//! socket seam; `lookup` is the walk, `frontier` its state, `flight` the
//! window of queries in the air, and `items` the two BEP 44 verbs over it.
//! Synchronous throughout — `std::net` with socket timeouts, no tokio
//! (AGENTS.md rule 8) — and every duration is a [`Config`] field a test can
//! shorten, so the fake DHT the suite runs on loopback UDP answers in
//! milliseconds where the commons answers in seconds.
