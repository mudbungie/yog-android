//! The punch (yog REMOTE §13.3): TCP simultaneous open from one fixed port,
//! and the data path the wire then rides directly. The same mechanism thrall
//! carries (thrall bl-0a8b), reimplemented per component (REMOTE §13.7
//! ruling 2).
//!
//! **Listen and connect from one port.** A [`Punch`] binds its port twice
//! over — a listener per address family — and a punch toward the engine
//! binds a *third* socket to the same port per target and connects from it.
//! Whichever SYN lands first is the connection: the engine's on our
//! listener, ours on its, or both crossing in the middle, which is the
//! simultaneous open a NAT pair needs (REMOTE §13.8: a "one side just
//! listens" shortcut has no chance). That takes `SO_REUSEADDR` and
//! `SO_REUSEPORT` — the calls `socket2` exists to make, and the reason it is
//! a dependency (REMOTE §13.7 ruling 1, operator 2026-09-23; DESIGN §21.4).
//!
//! **The first stream that lands is the connection** — the client's half of
//! REMOTE §13.3's rule. The engine serves every stream that lands and lets
//! the one nobody speaks on die in its handshake, so this end keeps the
//! first and drops the rest, and no negotiation over which is needed.
//!
//! **The one socket this app ever listens on, and only inside a window.** It
//! exists only on an entry holding rendezvous material, only for the length
//! of one climb (`ladder::Ladder`), and it accepts only inside the window
//! this end opened by calling the engine — DESIGN §1's *"the phone opens no
//! listening socket"* holds everywhere else, and §21.4 states the exception.
//!
//! **v6 first** where both ends published it (REMOTE §13.3): a stateful v6
//! firewall has no ports to rewrite. Targets are punched in parallel
//! regardless — the ordering is which stream this end sees first.
